## Introduction 

This R markdown script makes a table of all Variable Importance Measures (VIMs) that appeared in any of the
models' top five most important variables (models built in /research/analysis/prediction_models.Rmd). 

Example data that can be used to make this graph is available under research/visualise/data/VIMs/. 
The example are the VIMs from the models classifying successful and unsuccessful Housing Options outcomes
in the Glasgow PREVENT1 sample. 

The raw and cleaned data that the models were built on is not made available in this repository due to data sensitivity / confidentiality reasons. 

A fake synthetic example of the data set is available in /clean_data/clean_data.csv.

The following chunk loads the libraries necessary. Install these using install.packages("package name").

```{r}
library("tidyverse")
library("gridExtra")
library("grid")
```

The following chunk builds any functions required later on. 
```{r}
# rename category names to better names for visualisation
# this is specific to the data that is loaded in the next chunk
