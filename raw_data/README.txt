This folder should contain your raw data. 
This raw data needs cleaned. 
A copy of the cleaned data will go into the clean data folder. 
The raw data should never be touched in future. All analysis will be done on a copy of the cleaned data.
It should remain as it was when first obtained in case you ever need to use the original data or redo some cleaning steps. 

No raw data is found in this folder for this GitHub repository as it was sensitive and not public. 
A synthesised data set consisting of 1,000 rows is found in the clean data set. 
The code in the research folder is run on this synthesised (fake) data set.
